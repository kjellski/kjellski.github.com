# Where am I?
You're at Kjellskis Github Page, but you can reach me at @kjellski on twitter.

# What are you doing here?
Right now I'm just starting to fiddle a bit with git and github, but most probably this will, in the far future, be my personal git repository with open source contributions too. I use bitbucket for my private projects: https://bitbucket.org/kjellski

# Who are you?
I'm an informatics technology studen, right now I'm near my master thesis but it will be finished in 2013. I'll always continue to studie different topics in this area so that won't change at all...
